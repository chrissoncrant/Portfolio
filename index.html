                        <p>I'm a Full-Stack Web Developer hailing from Sacramento, California.</p>

                        <ol>
                            <li>Create websites that offer impactful experiences.</li>

                    <h2>A Bit About Me</h2>
                    <p>I graduated CSU, Sacramento with a BA in Communications who has spent several years working in the tech support/customer service industry for a major corporation.</p>
                    <p>Feeling that my innate problem solving capabilites were becoming dulled by familiarity and the lack of true challenges within the work itself I found myself searching for something else.</p>
                    <p>The search led me here, to this world of computer languages, coding, software development and engineering. I believe whole-hearteldy that I have found what I was looking for. I am excited to discover what awaits me as I continue down this promising path.</p>
                    <p>I feel fortunate to have found <a href="https://www.thinkful.com/bootcamp/web-development/" target="_blank">Thinkful's Immersive Engineering</a> course to help accelerate my learning and help me to hone my skills so that I can get out there and make a ruckus!</p>
