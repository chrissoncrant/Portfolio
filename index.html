                    <p>I'm a Full-Stack Web Developer from Sacramento, California.</p>
                    <p>My current mission is to hone my skills in front and back-end languages in order to:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Create websites that offer impactful experiences.</li>
                        <li>Package and wrap peoples' dreams within digital frameworks that draw in customers and fans.</li>
                        <li>Help populate the web with inspiring havens of information and oases of easily accessible services.</li>

                <h2>A Bit About Me</h2>
                <p>I graduated from CSU, Sacramento with a B.A. in Communications and since then I have spent several years working in the tech support/customer service industry.</p>
                <p>Feeling burnt-out with this work I began searching for something new, something that would challenge me while playing on my strengths.</p>
                <p>The search led me to the world of coding and software development. I believe whole-heartedly that I have found what I have been looking for and am excited for what awaits me as I continue down this promising path.</p>
                <p>I feel fortunate to have come across <a href="https://www.thinkful.com/bootcamp/web-development/" target="_blank">Thinkful's Immersive Engineering</a> course as I believe it will help me hone the necessary skills needed to  thrive in this industry.</p>
                <p>One part of this journey I am especially excited about is to meet other future and current developers along the way, building meaningful relationships while doing interesting work!</p>
                <p>When I am not coding, I spend a good deal of time playing guitar and dabbling in musical composition. I am finding that music and coding are quite synergetic!</p>
