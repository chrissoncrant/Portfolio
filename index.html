                    <p>I'm a Full-Stack Web Developer from Sacramento, California.</p>

                <h2>A Bit About Me</h2>
                <p>I graduated from CSU, Sacramento with a B.A. in Communications in 2016. Since then, I have been working in the tech support/customer service industry.</p>
                <p>Feeling burnt-out by this gig, I began searching for something new. I knew I wanted to find something that would challenge me while playing on my strengths.</p>
                <p>The search led me to the world of coding and software development, and, let me tell you, <i>this is what I've been searching for!</i></p>
                <p>I feel fortunate that I found <a href="https://www.thinkful.com/bootcamp/web-development/" target="_blank">Thinkful's Immersive Engineering</a> course. I believe it will be crucial in helping me to hone the necessary skills needed to thrive in this industry.</p>
                <p>I am excited to meet and work with other future and current developers along the way. I believe that the combination of building meaningful relationships while doing interesting work is priceless.</p>
                <p>When not coding, I love to play guitar and dabble in musical composition. And I am finding that music and coding are wonderfully synergistic!</p>
